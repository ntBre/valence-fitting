This figure shows the QM torsion drive profile (solid line) compared to the
functional form in the force field itself (dashed line).

This figure shows the QM profile versus the MM profile from Lily's presentation
on torsions that need more data. Clearly the MM result is still similar in
profile to the QM data, despite the functional form of the torsion parameter. Is
this the only metric that matters, or should the functional form be adjusted
too?
