both my torsion multiplicity (TM) force field trained with the TM data set and
the original Sage 2.1.0 force field trained on the TM data performed worse in
the benchmarks than the original Sage 2.1.0 force field trained on the Sage data
set. The purpose of this subdirectory is to try to reproduce the Sage FF/Sage
data training process
